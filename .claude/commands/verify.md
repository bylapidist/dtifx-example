description: Run ESLint and design-lint verification
---

Run the complete verification workflow for this repository:

1. Execute `npm run verify` which runs both ESLint and design-lint
2. Report the results showing any linting errors or design token violations
3. If there are violations, explain what they are and suggest fixes
4. Do not make any changes unless explicitly asked

After running, provide a summary of:
- ESLint status (passed/failed, number of errors/warnings)
- design-lint status (passed/failed, number of violations)
- Any files that need attention
