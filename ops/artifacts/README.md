# Artefact Storage

- `build/` – DTIF build outputs from `npm run dtif:build` (registry.json, tokens.json, tokens.css, telemetry.json).
- `diff/` – Baseline snapshot and comparison reports created by `npm run dtif:diff`.
- `audit/` – Governance evidence (report.json, report.md) written by `npm run dtif:audit`.
- `validate/` – Optional logs saved from `npm run dtif:validate` when CLI output needs to be committed.
