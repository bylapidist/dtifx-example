# Audit Reports

- `report.json` and `report.md` capture the latest results from `npm run dtif:audit`, which shells out to the DTIF CLI and filters runtime logs before writing commit-ready evidence.
- Replace the files after each audit run so reviewers always see the most recent governance evidence.
